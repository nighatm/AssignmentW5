        <p id="col1">The Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs; Dutch: De Smurfen) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a fictional colony of small, blue, human-like creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. The Smurfs was first created and introduced as a series of comic 
            characters by the Belgian comics artist Peyo (the pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, 
            wherein they were known as Les Schtroumpfs</p>

        <p id="col3">There are more than 100 Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that 
            emphasise their characteristics, such as "Jokey Smurf", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow
             smurfs. "Smurfette" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. 
            The Smurfs wear Phrygian caps, which came to represent freedom during the modern era</p>
